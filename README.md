## 🌟 Project Highlights

- **Medallion Architecture**  
  Implemented a multi-layered data pipeline with progressive refinement through three core layers:  
  - **Landing Zone** (raw data ingestion)  
  - **Bronze Layer** (raw data stored in Microsoft SQL Server)  
  - **Silver Layer** (cleaned, standardized, and transformed data)

- **Data Ingestion**  
  Successfully ingested raw pizza sales data into Microsoft SQL Server, establishing the Bronze Layer foundation.

- **Data Transformation**  
  Utilized SQL queries to perform comprehensive data cleaning, standardization, and transformation within the Silver Layer, preparing data for analytics.

- **Output & Accessibility**  
  Exported the refined datasets into optimized Parquet files, enhancing performance and compatibility with various analytical and BI tools.

## 📚 Learning Journey

This pipeline was developed during an insightful knowledge-sharing session led by Alif Irfan, a senior Data Engineer. The session provided hands-on experience with building scalable and maintainable data pipelines, emphasizing the importance and role of each Medallion Architecture layer. This project deepened my practical understanding of data engineering workflows and best practices.
